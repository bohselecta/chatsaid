# Phase 2: "Pick the Cherry" Enhanced Reaction System Checkpoint

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Focus:** Enhanced Reaction System with User Collections & AI Learning

## üçí What Changed

### **1. Enhanced "Pick the Cherry" System**
- **Dual Purpose Reactions**: Reactions now serve as both categorization AND collection
- **One Reaction Per Cherry**: Users can only pick one reaction type per cherry (heart, star, or zap)
- **Automatic Collection**: When a user reacts, the cherry is automatically added to their collection
- **AI Learning Integration**: Collected cherries are queued for AI companion learning

### **2. User Cherry Collections**
- **Personal Collection**: Each user has their own cherry collection
- **Reaction Categories**: Cherries are organized by reaction type (Love, Save, Inspire)
- **Collection Notes**: Users can add personal notes to collected cherries
- **AI Learning Status**: Track which cherries have been processed by AI companions

### **3. Enhanced Database Schema**
- **user_cherry_collections**: Tracks user's picked cherries
- **cherry_category_rankings**: Automatic ranking system based on reactions
- **user_ai_learning_preferences**: User preferences for AI learning
- **ai_learning_sessions**: Tracks AI processing of collected cherries

### **4. Improved User Experience**
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast messages confirm cherry picking/unpicking
- **Reaction Descriptions**: Clear labels (Love this insight, Save for later, Inspiring idea)
- **Enhanced Nudges**: Better messaging about AI learning benefits
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback for reactions

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Updated Components**
- `InteractiveCherryCard.tsx`: Enhanced with "pick the cherry" functionality
- `app/api/reactions/route.ts`: Updated to handle collections and rankings
- `app/api/user/collections/route.ts`: New API for user collections
- `supabase/migrations/20250115000002_phase2_user_cherry_collections.sql`: Database schema

### **New Features**
- **Automatic Collection Syncing**: Database triggers sync reactions with collections
- **Category Rankings**: Real-time ranking system for cherry discovery
- **AI Learning Queue**: System to process collected cherries for AI companions
