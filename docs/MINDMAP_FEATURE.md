- Filter and explore your content chronologically

### 2. **Interactive Mind Map Visualization**
- **Canvas-based visualization** with drag, zoom, and pan
- **Smart connections** between related cherries
- **Color-coded relationships**:
  - üîµ Blue: Same branch type
  - üü¢ Green: Content similarity
  - üü° Yellow: Same source file
  - üî¥ Red: Time proximity

### 3. **AI Insights Engine**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Discover your dominant interests and activity patterns
- **Goal Suggestions**: Get personalized recommendations for growth
- **Connection Analysis**: Understand relationships between your cherries
- **Content Insights**: Identify themes and recurring topics

### 4. **Statistics Dashboard**
- Total cherries count
- Branches explored
- Review status overview
- Image attachments count

## üéØ How to Use

### Accessing Your Mind Map
1. Navigate to `/mindmap` or click "üß† Mind Map" in the header
2. You must be logged in to access your personal mind map
3. The page will automatically load all your cherries

### Getting AI Insights

   - Summary of your AI conversation journey
   - Patterns discovered across your content
   - Suggested goals for personal growth
   - Key connections between related topics
   - Actionable recommendations

### Exploring the Visualization
- **Click nodes** to see cherry details
- **Drag** to pan around the mind map
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Reset View** button to return to default position

### Understanding Connections
- **Thicker lines** = stronger relationships
- **Node size** indicates connection count
- **Color coding** shows relationship types
- **Hover effects** highlight related cherries

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- `MindMapPage`: Main page component with stats and insights
- `MindMapVisualizer`: Canvas-based interactive visualization
- `AIInsightsService`: Service for AI analysis and API integration

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Cherry {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  created_at: string;
  branch_type: string;
  twig_name?: string;
  source_file?: string;
  line_number?: number;
  image_url?: string;
  review_status: string;
}
```

### Connection Algorithm
The mind map automatically generates connections based on:
1. **Branch Type**: Same category (funny, mystical, technical, research)
2. **Content Similarity**: Common keywords and themes
3. **Source Files**: Same project or document references
4. **Time Proximity**: Conversations within 24 hours
5. **Twig Relationships**: Same sub-community

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Current)
- ‚úÖ Basic mind map visualization
- ‚úÖ Mock AI insights
- ‚úÖ Connection algorithms
- ‚úÖ Interactive canvas

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- **Real AI Integration**: OpenAI API for actual insights
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, branch filters, content search
- **Export Features**: PNG, SVG, or PDF mind maps
- **Collaboration**: Share mind maps with others

### Phase 3 (Future)
- **Learning Paths**: AI-generated study sequences
- **Goal Tracking**: Progress monitoring and milestones
- **Integration**: Connect with external learning platforms
- **Mobile App**: Touch-friendly mind map exploration

## üí° Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Regular Review**: Visit your mind map weekly to track progress
2. **Metadata Completion**: Fill in source files and line numbers for better connections
3. **Branch Diversity**: Explore different branches to build a balanced knowledge base
4. **Review Process**: Mark cherries as reviewed to track your learning journey

### For Developers
1. **API Key Security**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
2. **Performance**: Implement pagination for large cherry collections
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure canvas interactions work with screen readers
4. **Mobile**: Optimize touch interactions for mobile devices

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **User Isolation**: Each user only sees their own cherries
- **API Key Storage**: Keys are stored locally and never sent to our servers
- **Data Privacy**: Cherry content remains private to the user
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security through Supabase RLS

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Canvas Not Loading**: Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. **No Cherries Showing**: Ensure you're logged in and have created posts
3. **AI Insights Failing**: Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
4. **Performance Issues**: Try reducing zoom level or resetting the view

### Browser Support
- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support
- **Mobile Browsers**: Limited support (planned enhancement)
